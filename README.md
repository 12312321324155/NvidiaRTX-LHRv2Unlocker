# Nvidia RTX LHR v2 Unlocker
The first fully automated BIOS modifier for RTX cards with LHR v2 lock. Using it is simple, intuitive and requires no advanced knowledge.

It enables the modification of previously read BIOS files (using HiveOs or other mining OS) and reading the BIOS from the graphics card installed in the system, then automatic backup, file modification and flash memory using the modified BIOS.

In addition, it also modifies files in Axxxx series cards, increasing their performance. At the moment, no integration with more modern Nvidia graphics cards is planned.

<b>Planned release: 02/26/2022 this will be the Early Access version.</b>
