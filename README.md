# Nvidia RTX LHR v2 Unlocker
The first fully automated BIOS modifier for RTX cards with LHR v2 lock. Using it is simple, intuitive and requires no advanced knowledge.

It enables the modification of previously read BIOS files (using HiveOs or other mining OS) and reading the BIOS from the graphics card installed in the system, then automatic backup, file modification and flash memory using the modified BIOS.

In addition, it also modifies files in RTX Axxxx series cards, increasing their performance. At the moment, no integration with more modern Nvidia graphics cards is planned.

<b>Planned release: 02/26/2022 this will be the Early Access version.</b>

# Requirements
Modifying the BIOS is not enough to fully hashrate your graphics card. You also need graphics drivers modified by me. They are downloaded and installed automatically in Windows when the program is installed. If you are using another OS such as HiveOs etc. then you need to install the drivers manually according to the instructions found in the DRIVER_INSTALATION.txt file in the application installation folder.

# Examples
Screenshots from Minerstat Dashboard - mining ETH on 2miners mining pool with LOLMINER v1.45. I tested all cards individually, on the same motherboard, plugged directly into the PCI-e x16 slot without risers.

Thanks to Markus, Tomas and Robert for helping me get graphics cards for testing, for believing it would work.
